# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

[Aiden's Work Day Scheduler](https://a-thread.github.io/Daily-Scheduler/)

The assignment was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### jQuery
At first I tried dynamically building each time block inside my script but had trouble saving to local storage so I ended up building all of the html separately and used my script file to interact with Moment.js and save/clear events in localStorage.

### Moment.js
Using Moment.js was actually a lot of fun! Once I got my bearings in the documentation, it was nice to be able to make this app feel more contemporary by linking using Moment.js to make the styling and Header responsive to the passing time.

### Styling
All of the styling for this app was included in the start docs but I ended up changing the color palette and font to make it feel more contemporary and personalized.
